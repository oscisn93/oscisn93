##### Hi, Iâ€™m Oscar Cisneros, I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in computer science at California State University, Fullerton, on pace to graduate in 2024, with the primary focus of developing as a software engineer.
##### Iâ€™m interested in artificial intelligence and real-time machine learning applications long term (post graduation). I currently have experience with web development- specifically node.js, php, express.js, mongoose/mongo, MySQL, javascript/ES6, react, axios, consnsumnig/creating apis, build systems- webpack, typescript, babel, bun.js, and the ablility to translate the frontend & backend knowledge learned in these languages to new stacks. I have exposure to and to some extent, profociency in, Python, C/C++, ARM Assembly/microcontrollers, VHDL and automation scripts in a linux environment (bash,python) to improve  workflows. Would love to eventually combine my current web-related knowledge to my interest of macahine learning/AI.
#### Currently documenting and enhanching a web app I built for my software engineering course: https://github.com/oscisn93/FoCal.
