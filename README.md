##### Hi, Iâ€™m Oscar Cisneros, I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in computer science at California State University, Fullerton, with the primary focus of developing as a software engineer.
##### Iâ€™m interested in artificial intelligence and real-time machine learning applications, however I currently primarily have (relevant) experience with web development- specifically node.js, php, express.js, mongoose/mongo, MySQL, javascript/ES6, react, axios, consnsumnig/creating apis, build systems- webpack, typescript, babel, bun.js, and the ablility to translate the frontend & backend knowledge learned in these languages to new stacks. Would love to eventually combine my current web-related knowledge to my interest of macahine learning/AI.
#### Currently working on a fullstack web application for my Intro to Software Engineering course(CPSC-362): https://github.com/DByoyoer/FoCal.
