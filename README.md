- 👋 Hi, I’m @oscisn93
- 👀 I’m interested in autonomous systems as a long term career goal. Other interests include web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and software engineering projects in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my Python and C++ skills and learning about compilers, programming languages and computer security.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a fullstack application with a Typescript/React frontend, and a PHP, MySQL, and Node.js backend and would like to get involved in long projects involving python such as data analysis and machine learning.
