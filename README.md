## About Me

Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in computer science at Cal State Fullerton (CSUF), on pace to graduate in 2024, with the primary focus of developing as a software engineer.

I currently have experience with web development, with a strong preference for building and maintaining backend applications, as well as basic systems-level programming. I would love to eventually combine my current knowledge to my personal intellectual interests which include AI, computational biology, neuroscience, and cognitive science. Ultimately Iâ€™m interested in working on real-time applications of artificial intelligence and in the intersection of natural science and computer science.
